# touchcursor-win
Port of the touchcursor-linux project to windows.

This application was designed to remap the `uiophjklnmy` keys to different movement keys when the spacebar is pressed down, allowing you to keep your hands on the home row. It has grown to allow remapping all the keys, even the hyper key.

```
i - up
j - left
k - down
l - right
u - home
o - end
p - backspace
h - page up
n - page down
m - del
y - insert
```
